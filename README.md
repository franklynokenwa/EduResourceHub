# EduResourceHub
This project involves the development of a web app for the educational sector which contains features that streamlines the teaching process by eradicating the need of students coping complex notes in class but enables them to concentrate more on getting the required knowledge from their teachers.

The App allows teachers to upload their lesson notes before each academic week and students can also access the lesson notes. It also contains an Attendance Management system incorporated in it.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
It was observed that student and teachers spend so much time writing notes where they should have used the same time to focus on learning and practice and secondly, many teachers keep track of the attendance of students by recording the data on paper which might be stressful, inconsistent and can easily be lost.
